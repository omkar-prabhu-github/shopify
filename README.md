## 📌 Project Overview

**Axiom** is a production-grade, full-stack Shopify embedded application built to solve a problem that didn't exist five years ago — but will define the next decade of e-commerce: **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**.

Traditional SEO optimizes for search engine crawlers. GEO optimizes for AI assistants — ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Copilot — that are rapidly replacing Google as the primary interface for product discovery. When a customer asks an AI *"What's the best snowboard for beginners?"*, the AI doesn't rank your meta tags. It reads your content, extracts facts, evaluates trust signals, and decides whether to recommend your product or your competitor's.

**Most Shopify merchants have zero visibility into how AI perceives their store. Axiom fixes that.**

The platform ingests an entire Shopify store — products, collections, blogs, policies, discounts, and metadata — runs it through a dual-model AI pipeline (Gemini 2.5 Flash + Gemma 4 31B), produces a forensic GEO Health Score, and delivers a one-click fix engine that writes corrections directly back to the Shopify Admin API.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Traditional SEO optimizes for search engine crawlers. But the commerce landscape is shifting — **40% of Gen Z now uses AI chatbots instead of Google** for product discovery (Google Internal Data, 2024). When a customer asks ChatGPT *"What's the best waterproof jacket under ₹5000?"*, the AI doesn't crawl your meta tags. It evaluates:

- **Can it extract a clear, quotable answer?** ("The Axiom Pro is ideal for beginners because...")
- **Does the content contain verifiable statistics?** (dimensions, ratings, comparisons)
- **Are trust signals present?** (reviews, policies, certifications)
- **Is the data structured for machine consumption?** (clean HTML, FAQ blocks, structured attributes)

Most Shopify merchants have **zero visibility into how AI perceives their store**. They're optimizing for a world that no longer exists — and losing sales to competitors whose content happens to be more AI-readable.

### The Gap: Without GEO vs. With Axiom

| Without GEO | With Axiom |
|---|---|
| AI skips your products entirely | AI cites your products in top-3 recommendations |
| Generic descriptions with no stats | Data-rich, quotable product copy |
| Missing policies erode trust signals | Complete policy coverage detected & fixed |
| No FAQ content for AI extraction | Structured Q&A blocks AI can cite verbatim |
| Blind to how AI "sees" your store | Full diagnostic dashboard with layer-by-layer scoring |
| Descriptions that are "marketing fluff" | Evidence-backed, justification-rich content |

## 💡 Solution & Product Thinking

### Who Is This For?

Axiom targets **non-technical Shopify store owners** who:
- Don't know what GEO is, but are losing sales to AI-driven discovery
- Can't afford an SEO agency but need actionable, specific fixes
- Want one-click solutions, not a checklist of technical jargon
- Run stores with 10–500 products and want to stay competitive as AI reshapes commerce

### Core Design Principles

1. **Zero-Jargon UI**: Every issue, score, and recommendation is written in plain language. No "JSON-LD", "canonical URLs", or "meta tags" — just *"Your product info isn't set up for AI assistants."*
2. **Fix, Don't Just Report**: Every diagnostic finding comes with a concrete, editable, one-click fix that writes directly to the Shopify Admin API via GraphQL mutations.
3. **AI Audits AI**: We use AI (Gemini + Gemma) to audit how other AIs will perceive your store — fighting fire with fire with deterministic constraints.
4. **Deductive Scoring (Anti-Hallucination)**: Scores start at 100 and deduct only for verified issues. This prevents score inflation and ensures scores never drop after fixes are applied.
5. **Server-Side Integrity**: The audit always fetches store data server-side using admin tokens — a merchant can never send fabricated data to manipulate their own GEO score.

## 🚀 Platform Features

| # | Feature | Core Capability | AI Model | Key Outputs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Store GEO Audit** | Full-store AI readiness analysis | Gemini 2.5 Flash | 0–100 Health Score, 6 layer scores, executive summary, priority action plan |
| 2 | **Product Deep Analysis** | Per-product 15-test diagnostic | Gemma 4 31B (Multimodal) | SEO/GEO/Content/Image scores, issues, one-click fixes |
| 3 | **Blog Intelligence** | Per-article 12-test diagnostic + AI generation | Gemma 4 31B | Readability/SEO/GEO scores, rewrite suggestions, full article generation |
| 4 | **One-Click Fix Engine** | GraphQL mutation applicator | Deterministic | Applies product, page, policy, blog fixes directly to Shopify Admin |

### Feature 1 — Store-Level GEO Audit (Gemini 3 Flash)
- Ingests **entire store data**: up to 50 products, all collections, pages, policies, blogs, discounts, redirects, and store metadata
- Produces a **0–100 GEO Health Score** across 6 weighted scoring layers
- Generates a **severity-ranked action plan** (CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW) with machine-applicable fixes
- Provides an **executive summary** highlighting the top threat and top opportunity
- Internally generates a **Store Context Synthesis** — a 400-word brand identity profile saved server-side to power all subsequent product analyses

### Feature 2 — Product Deep-Dive Analysis (Gemma 4 31B — Multimodal)
- Runs **15 diagnostic tests** per product across SEO, GEO, Content, and Image categories
- **Multimodal**: fetches and analyzes up to 3 actual product images alongside the text description
- **Cross-validates** descriptions against images (e.g., *"description claims 5 colors but images show only 1"*)
- **Cross-references** product claims against the saved store context baseline for compliance
- Returns scored analysis with `overallScore`, `riskLevel`, and concrete, API-ready `fixes[]`

### Feature 3 — Blog Intelligence Engine (Gemma 4 31B)
- Runs **12 diagnostic tests** per article across SEO, Readability, and GEO categories
- AI-powered blog **generation** with GEO-optimized structure: ≥5 statistics, ≥3 justification fragments, FAQ sections
- One-click **publish to Shopify** via REST API with blog selector
- Existing article analysis with specific, field-level rewrite suggestions

### Feature 4 — One-Click Fix Engine
- Every AI finding includes a machine-applicable fix with exact `oldValue` → `newValue` pairs
- **Editable preview modal** before applying — merchants can tweak AI suggestions
- **Intelligent GID resolution**: handles → GIDs, titles → GIDs, numeric IDs → GIDs (3-strategy fallback)
- **Fallback logic**: if a page update fails (page doesn't exist), auto-creates it
- **Fix registry**: tracks applied fixes in-session to prevent duplicate re-suggestions

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Axiom is a decoupled, three-tier system with a strict boundary between its AI reasoning layer and its deterministic data/mutation layer:

```

**Traffic Flow:**
- **ngrok** tunnels `https://<id>.ngrok-free.app` → `localhost:3000` (Express) during local development
- Express serves the Vite production build at `/` and proxies non-API requests to `localhost:5173` in dev mode
- Shopify OAuth callbacks hit `localhost:3000/api/auth/callback`
- All AI calls go directly from the Node.js backend — the React frontend never calls Google AI APIs directly

### AI / Deterministic Boundary

The most critical architectural decision in Axiom. Every operation is classified into exactly one of two layers:

| Layer | Operations | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Deterministic** | Data extraction, GID resolution, fix application, score math | Correctness required; zero variance acceptable |
| **AI Reasoning** | Issue identification, fix content generation, image evaluation, blog generation | Judgment required; rules cannot substitute |

Mixing these layers causes instability. Axiom keeps them strictly separate.

## 📖 The 10 GEO Principles (Research-Backed)

Axiom's entire audit framework is built on 10 GEO principles distilled from academic research on how generative AI engines select, rank, and cite e-commerce content. Every scoring layer, every diagnostic test, and every fix template traces back to one of these principles.

| # | Principle | What It Means | How Axiom Tests It |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Third-Party Authority** | AI favors earned media (reviews, expert mentions) over brand-owned content | Checks for review signals, expert quotes, certification references |
| 2 | **AI Answer Visibility** | Success = appearing *inside* the AI's response, not just being indexed | Evaluates if content is "citation-ready" with quotable, standalone statements |
| 3 | **Justifiability** | AI is a decision engine — content must explain *why* | Counts "ideal for", "best for", "recommended because" fragments (min 3/product) |
| 4 | **Structured Data** | Treat your store as an API for AI | Audits JSON-LD completeness, FAQ markup, product schema richness |
| 5 | **High-Impact Strategies** | Stats (+30-40%), Citations (+30-40%), Quotes (+25-35%), Fluency (+15-30%) | Measures statistics density (min 5/product), citation readiness, prose quality |
| 6 | **Engine-Specific Optimization** | GPT wants authority, Gemini wants structure, Perplexity wants citations | Cross-engine scoring layer evaluates optimization for each AI platform |
| 7 | **Full Purchase Journey** | Content must cover Awareness → Consideration → Decision → Post-purchase | Checks for guides, comparison pages, pricing transparency, care instructions |
| 8 | **GEO Defense** | Build a moat of high-authority content to prevent competitor displacement | Identifies content gaps competitors could exploit |
| 9 | **The Equalizer** | GEO offers +115% boost for lower-ranked sites — quality beats brand size | Prioritizes high-impact, low-effort fixes for smaller stores |
| 10 | **AI Readability** | Semantic clarity and extraction readiness over keyword density | Tests scannability, Q&A format, standalone factual statements |

> **Research Foundation**: These principles are derived from the paper *"GEO: Generative Engine Optimization"* (Aggarwal et al., 2023) and subsequent industry analyses on AI-driven product discovery.

### Six GEO Scoring Layers

| Layer | Weight | What Is Scored |
|---|---|---|
| **Schema & Structured Data** | /20 pts | JSON-LD completeness, product schema, FAQ markup |
| **Content Quality** | /20 pts | Description depth, statistics density, justification fragments |
| **Trust Signals** | /15 pts | Reviews, certifications, policy coverage, return info |
| **Extractability** | /15 pts | Citation-readiness, quotable statements, AI scannability |
| **Journey & Policy** | /20 pts | Purchase journey coverage, policy pages, comparison content |
| **Cross-Engine Visibility** | /10 pts | Optimization for GPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Copilot |

**Deduction Scale:** CRITICAL → −20 pts · HIGH → −10 pts · MEDIUM → −5 pts · LOW → −2 pts

---

## 🤖 AI Pipeline: Dual-Model Strategy

### Why Two Models?

| Aspect | Gemini 2.5 Flash (Store Audit) | Gemma 4 31B IT (Product & Blog) |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Holistic store-level GEO audit | Granular per-product / per-article analysis |
| **Input Size** | ~50 products + policies + blogs (~5K–200K tokens) | Single product + images (~2K–5K tokens) |
| **Modality** | Text-only | **Multimodal** (text + product images) |
| **Output** | 6 layer scores + category scores + action plan | 4 category scores + 15 test results + fixes |
| **Temperature** | 0.1 (deterministic, consistent scoring) | 0.1 (analysis) / 0.7 (blog generation) |
| **Why This Model** | Large context window, fast, structured JSON output | Best open-weight model for image+text structured analysis |

### 2-Layer API Fallback Chain

```
Request
  │
  ├─► Primary API Key + gemini-3-flash-preview
  │     └─ 429 / 503 / 404 / overloaded → continue
  │
  ├─► Primary API Key + gemini-2.5-flash
  │     └─ 429 / 503 / 404 → continue
  │
  ├─► Fallback API Key + gemini-3-flash-preview
  │     └─ still failing → continue
  │
  └─► Fallback API Key + gemini-2.5-flash
        └─ all fail → graceful error to user
```

For **Gemma** (product / blog), additional per-key exponential backoff:
- **3 attempts per key** with `1500ms × attempt` delay
- Blocks `SAFETY` / `RECITATION` finish reasons
- Ensures `overallScore` exists before accepting response
- Neutral score (50) returned on full exhaustion — no crash

### Failure Mode Matrix

| Failure Mode | Detection | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Gemini 429 rate limit | HTTP status | Auto-fallback to next model/key |
| Gemini overloaded | Error message match | Auto-fallback |
| Gemini model 404 | HTTP 404 | Skip, try next model |
| Gemma response blocked | `finishReason !== STOP` | Retry with backoff |
| Gemma empty output | `rawText === ''` | Retry |
| Gemma malformed JSON | `JSON.parse` throws | `extractJSON()` bracket-matching |
| Image fetch fails | HTTP error | Skip image, text-only analysis |
| Fix — page missing | `userErrors` non-empty | Auto `pageCreate` fallback |
| Fix — policy auto-managed | `userErrors` has "automatic" | Manual instructions returned |
| AI returns handle not GID | `lastPart` not numeric | 3-strategy GID resolution |
| Payload over 200k tokens | Token estimate | Truncate: 50 → 30 products |

### Store Context Synthesis — The Coherence Layer

After every store audit, Gemini generates a ~400-word internal brand profile:
- Store identity + target demographic
- Product categories + price positioning
- Core policies (shipping, returns, refunds)
- Value propositions + brand voice markers

This synthesis is **saved server-side only** (never sent to the frontend) in `policyStore`. It is injected as ground truth context into every subsequent per-product and blog analysis, ensuring Gemma's output is brand-consistent — not generic.

> **Why hidden from frontend?** If merchants can read the synthesis, they craft descriptions to match it — gaming the GEO score rather than genuinely improving AI readiness. It is an internal evaluation tool, not a merchant deliverable.

### Per-Product Analysis — 15 Diagnostic Tests

Gemma 4 31B runs 15 enumerated, specific tests across 4 categories per product:

| Category | Tests | Key Thresholds |
|---|---|---|
| **SEO (T1–T4)** | Title structure, snippet readiness, keyword density, URL slug quality | — |
| **GEO (T5–T8)** | Statistics density, justification fragments, citation readiness, comparison anchors | ≥5 stats, ≥3 justification phrases |
| **Content (T9–T12)** | Description depth & word count, image↔description cross-validation, policy compliance, tag quality | — |
| **Image (T13–T15)** | Count & diversity, alt text audit, visual quality assessment (actual multimodal image analysis) | — |

Each test returns a `pass/fail`, severity level, issue description, and a machine-applicable `fix` object with exact `oldValue`/`newValue`.

### Supported Fix Types

| Fix Type | Shopify Operation | Target Resource |
|---|---|---|
| `product_title` | `productUpdate` | Product title field |
| `product_description` | `productUpdate` | `descriptionHtml` field |
| `product_tags` | `productUpdate` | Tags array |
| `product_metafield` | `metafieldsSet` | Custom namespace + key |
| `page_content` | `pageUpdate` → fallback `pageCreate` | Page body HTML |
| `page_title` | `pageUpdate` | Page title |
| `collection_description` | `collectionUpdate` | `descriptionHtml` |
| `shop_policy` | `shopPolicyUpdate` | REFUND / PRIVACY / SHIPPING / TOS |
| `article_title` | `articleUpdate` | Blog article title |
| `article_body` | `articleUpdate` | Blog article body HTML |
| `article_tags` | `articleUpdate` | Blog article tags array |

### Fix Registry — Session Deduplication

```typescript
// aiFixRegistry.ts — module-level Map, persists across all renders
registerAIFix(resourceId, field, label):
  key = `${resourceId}::${field}::${label}`
  registry.set(key, true)

filterAlreadyFixed(fixes[]):
  return fixes.filter(f =>
    !registry.has(`${f.resourceId}::${f.field}::${f.label}`)
  )
```

Once a fix is applied, that exact `(resource + field + label)` combination is permanently excluded from the UI in the current session — preventing duplicate re-suggestions after partial application.

## 📝 Deep Dive: Blog Intelligence Engine

### Blog Analysis — 12 Diagnostic Tests (Gemma 4 31B)

| Category | Tests |
|---|---|
| **SEO (T1–T4)** | Title optimization, heading structure (H2/H3), keyword strategy, snippet readiness |
| **Readability (T5–T8)** | Paragraph length, sentence complexity, scannability (lists/headers), word count |
| **GEO (T9–T12)** | Statistics density (≥5), justification fragments (≥3), E-E-A-T signals, FAQ readiness |

Injected with `policyStore` context for brand-aligned analysis. Returns `seoScore`, `readabilityScore`, `geoScore`, `overallScore`, `issues[]`, and `fixes[]`.

### Blog Generation + Publish Flow

```
Merchant enters topic
       │  POST /api/blog/generate  { topic, blogId }
       ▼
  runBlogGeneration(shop, topic)
  └─ Inject policyStore context (brand voice, policies)
  └─ temperature: 0.7  (creative mode — varied output)
  └─ Gemma 4 31B generates:
       {
         title, bodyHtml, tags[], metaDescription, summary
       }

  bodyHtml is GEO-structured and includes:
  ├─ <h2>/<h3> heading hierarchy
  ├─ ≥5 quantitative statistics with sources
  ├─ ≥3 justification fragments ("best for", "ideal when")
  ├─ FAQ section with 3–5 Q&A pairs (AI-extractable)
  ├─ Short paragraphs + bullet-point lists
  └─ Natural product/brand references

  If blogId provided:
       │  POST /admin/api/2024-10/blogs/{blogId}/articles.json
       ▼  Article published: true → Shopify
          Shopify article ID returned to frontend for confirmation
```

## 💬 Deep Dive: Prompting & Output Engineering

### System Prompt Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Plain language output** | Explicit forbidden-term list: JSON-LD, schema markup, GID, slug, canonical, semantic, metafield, E-E-A-T |
| **No hallucination** | "If data is missing, state DATA MISSING, apply deduction, never invent data" |
| **No generic advice** | "Every tip MUST reference specific keys, values, or strings from the input JSON" |
| **Stable scoring** | Deductive math enforced in prompt with explicit point values per severity |
| **Machine-applicable fixes** | Every finding must include `fixes[]` with exact `oldValue` + complete `newValue` |
| **AI-first mindset** | "Ask: Would an AI agent cite this product as a top-3 choice for a relevant query?" |

### Temperature Strategy

| Task | Temperature | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Store GEO audit | `0.1` | Reproducible scores; deterministic issue detection across runs |
| Per-product analysis | `0.1` | Consistent 15-test forensic evaluation |
| Blog analysis | `0.1` | Reliable scoring; predictable issue identification |
| Blog generation | `0.7` | Creative, varied content; non-generic long-form prose |

### Output Format Enforcement

| Model | Enforcement Method |
|---|---|
| Gemini (store audit) | `responseMimeType: "application/json"` + custom structural validation |
| Gemma (product) | `responseSchema: PRODUCT_ANALYSIS_SCHEMA` (JSON Schema enforcement) |
| Gemma (blog analyze) | `responseSchema: BLOG_ANALYSIS_SCHEMA` |
| Gemma (blog generate) | `responseSchema: BLOG_GENERATION_SCHEMA` |
| All models | `extractJSON()` bracket-matching fallback if primary `JSON.parse` fails |

## 🔐 Security & Authentication

### OAuth 2.0 Implementation

```
Merchant clicks Install
       │
       ▼  GET /api/auth?shop=store.myshopify.com
       │
       │  Redirect → Shopify OAuth consent screen
       │  Parameters: client_id, scopes, redirect_uri, state nonce
       │
       ▼  Merchant approves scopes in Shopify
       │
       │  GET /api/auth/callback?code=...&hmac=...&shop=...
       ├─ HMAC-SHA256 verification (crypto.timingSafeEqual — timing-attack safe)
       ├─ Authorization code → access_token exchange
       ├─ tokenStore.set(shop, { accessToken })
       └─ Redirect → React frontend (token in sessionStorage)

  Every subsequent API request:
  Headers: x-shopify-domain + x-shopify-token
  Backend: getValidToken(shop, reqToken) validates both
```

### Security Measures

| Measure | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **HMAC validation** | Every OAuth callback verified with `crypto.timingSafeEqual` (prevents timing attacks) |
| **Server-side token storage** | Tokens stored in in-memory `Map` — never exposed to frontend |
| **Data forgery prevention** | Audit fetches store data server-side; client-supplied body is explicitly ignored |
| **401 auto-recovery** | `authGuard.ts` detects expired sessions, wipes stale state, triggers re-authentication |
| **CSP headers** | `frame-ancestors` restricted to `*.myshopify.com` and `admin.shopify.com` |
| **Score integrity** | Audit endpoint never trusts client payloads — always re-fetches directly from Shopify |

### Requested API Scopes

```
read_products        write_products       read_content         write_content
read_customers       read_orders          read_inventory       write_inventory

## 🏪 Creating the Shopify App & Permissions

### Step 1 — Create the App

1. Log in to your [Shopify Partner Dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com/).
2. Go to **Apps** → **All apps** → **Create app**.
3. Select **Create app manually**.
4. Name the app **Axiom** and confirm.

### Step 2 — Configure API Scopes

In **App Settings** → **Configuration** → **Admin API integration**, request the full scope list above.

### Step 3 — Get Credentials

Navigate to **Client credentials** and copy:
- **Client ID** → maps to `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `VITE_SHOPIFY_API_KEY`
- **Client secret** → maps to `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`

### Step 4 — Create a Development Store

1. In Partner Dashboard → **Stores** → **Add store**.
2. Select **Development store**, fill in details, and create it.
3. This is the store you will install Axiom on for testing.

### Step 5 — Configure App URLs (ngrok for local dev)

Start ngrok on port 3000:
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

In Shopify Partner Dashboard → App → **Configuration**:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **App URL** | `https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app` |
| **Allowed redirection URL(s)** | `https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app/api/auth/callback` |

---

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the **root** of the project. This file is gitignored and must never be committed.

```env
# ─── Shopify App Credentials ────────────────────────────
SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_from_partner_dashboard
SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_from_partner_dashboard

# ─── App URL (ngrok for local / Render URL for prod) ────
SHOPIFY_APP_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app

# ─── Google AI ──────────────────────────────────────────
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_primary_google_ai_studio_key
GEMINI_API_KEY_FALLBACK=your_secondary_google_ai_studio_key

# ─── Vite (App Bridge needs the public API key) ─────────
VITE_SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_client_id_from_partner_dashboard

# ─── Runtime ────────────────────────────────────────────
NODE_ENV=development
```

| Variable | Where to Get It | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID` | Shopify Partner Dashboard → App → Client credentials | ✅ Yes |
| `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Shopify Partner Dashboard → App → Client credentials | ✅ Yes |
| `SHOPIFY_APP_URL` | Active ngrok HTTPS URL (dev) or Render URL (prod) | ✅ Yes |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) | ✅ Yes |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY_FALLBACK` | Google AI Studio (second key for the 4-step fallback chain) | ⚠️ Recommended |
| `VITE_SHOPIFY_API_KEY` | Same value as `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID` | ✅ Yes |

---

## 💻 Running the Application

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Minimum Version |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 20+ |
| npm | 9+ |
| Google Chrome | Latest stable |
| ngrok | Free account |
| Shopify Partner Account | — |

### Step 1 — Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omkar-prabhu-github/shopify.git
cd shopify
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Step 2 — Configure Environment

Copy and fill in `.env.local` as described in the [Environment Configuration](#-environment-configuration) section above.

### Step 3 — Start ngrok

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Update `SHOPIFY_APP_URL` in `.env.local` and in the Shopify Partner Dashboard App Configuration with the new HTTPS URL.

### Step 4 — Start the Servers

The `npm start` command uses `concurrently` to launch both the Express backend and Vite dev server simultaneously:

```bash
npm start
```

Expected terminal output:
```
✅ Backend running at http://localhost:3000
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

Individual commands if needed:
```bash
npm run proxy   # Express backend only (port 3000)
npm run dev     # Vite frontend only (port 5173)
```

### Step 5 — Install the App on Your Dev Store

1. Navigate to: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/install`
2. Enter your development store's `.myshopify.com` name.
3. Complete the OAuth flow — you will be redirected into the Shopify Admin.
4. The Axiom dashboard loads inside the Shopify Admin iframe.

---

## 🚀 Production Deployment (Render)

1. Connect your GitHub repo to [Render](https://render.com/).
2. **Build Command**: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps --include=dev && npm run build`
3. **Start Command**: `node backend/server.js`
4. Set all environment variables in the Render dashboard.
5. In Shopify Partner Dashboard → App → Configuration:
   - **App URL**: `https://axiom-dev.tech`
   - **Allowed redirection URL**: `https://axiom-dev.tech/api/auth/callback`

The `ecosystem.config.cjs` in the root provides a PM2 configuration for self-hosting on a VPS.

## 🎨 Deep Dive: Shopify Polaris

Axiom uses **[Shopify Polaris v13](https://polaris.shopify.com/)** as its primary UI system — a deliberate architectural decision, not just a styling choice.

### Why Polaris?

| Benefit | Details |
|---|---|
| **Merchant Trust** | Polaris components look identical to native Shopify UI, reducing friction and increasing adoption |
| **Accessibility** | Full ARIA compliance, keyboard navigation, and screen-reader support built-in |
| **Responsiveness** | Works seamlessly on Shopify Desktop Admin and the Shopify Mobile App |
| **Consistency** | Design tokens, spacing, and color systems ensure visual coherence across all four dashboard tabs |
| **iframe-Ready** | Built for the Shopify Admin iframe context — no custom CSP workarounds needed |

### Key Polaris Components in Use

| Component | Used In | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `<Page>` | All tabs | Standard page layout with title & action slots |
| `<Card>` / `<Box>` | All tabs | Content containers with native Shopify styling |
| `<Banner>` | Error & success states | User-facing status notifications |
| `<Spinner>` | All async AI calls | Loading indicators during audit / analysis |
| `<Button>` | All pages | Primary, secondary, and plain action variants |
| `<Badge>` | Issue severity | CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW visual tags |
| `<ProgressBar>` | Layer scores | GEO layer score visualization bars |
| `<Modal>` | Fix preview | Editable diff view before applying fixes |
| `<Tabs>` | AppShell | Overview / Actions / Products / Blogs navigation |
| `<TextField>` | Blog topic input | Polaris-styled inputs |

## 🧩 Design Decisions & Tradeoffs

### 1. Server-Side Data Fetching (Security > Speed)
**Decision**: The audit endpoint fetches all store data server-side using admin tokens; the client request body is ignored.
**Tradeoff**: Adds ~2–5s latency vs. passing frontend data directly.
**Rationale**: Prevents data forgery. A malicious actor could send fabricated store data to receive a falsely inflated GEO score. Server-side fetching guarantees audit integrity.

### 2. Dual-Model Architecture (Specialization > Simplicity)
**Decision**: Gemini for store-level audits, Gemma for product and blog analysis.
**Tradeoff**: More complex codebase; two sets of prompts and schemas to maintain.
**Rationale**: Gemini excels at large-context reasoning (50 products + policies simultaneously in one pass). Gemma 4 31B excels at multimodal analysis (text + product images). Using each model's strength produces higher-quality outputs than forcing one model to do both.

### 3. Deductive Scoring (Consistency > Flexibility)
**Decision**: All scores start at 100, deducting only for verified issues.
**Tradeoff**: Stores rarely score above 70 on first run — can feel harsh.
**Rationale**: Prevents the #1 LLM scoring problem: arbitrary initial scores that fluctuate between runs. Deductive scoring is monotonic — fixing an issue always improves the score, never reduces it.

### 4. In-Memory Token Storage (Simplicity > Persistence)
**Decision**: OAuth tokens stored in a JavaScript `Map`, not a database.
**Tradeoff**: Tokens lost on server restart; merchants must re-authenticate after deploys.
**Rationale**: Eliminates database setup complexity for hackathon scope. Production would use Redis or PostgreSQL with token encryption at rest.

### 5. Plain Language Blocklist (UX > Technical Precision)
**Decision**: System prompts contain an explicit blocklist of technical terms requiring plain-language equivalents in output.
**Tradeoff**: Power users might want technical details like JSON-LD specifics.
**Rationale**: Target users are non-technical store owners. *"Your product info isn't set up for AI assistants"* is actionable; *"Missing JSON-LD ProductSchema with aggregateRating markup"* is not.

### 6. Hash-Based SPA Routing (iframe Compatibility > DX)
**Decision**: `window.location.hash` navigation instead of React Router.
**Tradeoff**: URLs are less clean (`#/products` vs `/products`).
**Rationale**: Shopify embeds apps inside an iframe. Hash-based routing works without triggering full page reloads or breaking the OAuth session state, and requires zero additional dependencies.
